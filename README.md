Idfk what I'm doing is this the way lord Peanut? Anyways these will be prototype files that we wont use in the future. I'm planning on letting some players use these scripts just as long as they give credit.


--Update after Jan 8--

After a couple months in development the project will be discontinued. BelmarGames has been acquired by Blackstone Productions. After our current project is done (Ragdoll engine) the game will be revived. Or will  be used as a testing/learning project for beginner devs.
